        ## üìñ XREAD
        
        **Purpose:** Read from streams with optional blocking for real-time data consumption
        
        **Syntax:** `XREAD [BLOCK milliseconds] STREAMS key [key ...] id [id ...]`
        
        **What it does:**
        - Reads entries from one or more streams starting after specified IDs
        - EXCLUSIVE operation: returns entries with IDs greater than specified
        - Can block and wait for new data to arrive (real-time streaming)
        - Supports reading from multiple streams simultaneously
        
        **Key Features:**
        - **Non-blocking mode:** Get existing data immediately
        - **Blocking mode:** Wait for new data (BLOCK milliseconds)
        - **Multiple streams:** Monitor several streams at once
        - **Cursor-based:** Use last seen ID to continue reading
        
        **Special ID Values:**
        - `0` or `0-0`: Read from the beginning of the stream
        - `$`: Read only NEW entries (nothing initially, then new ones)
        - Specific ID: Read entries after this ID
        
        **Response Format:**
        ```
        [
          ["stream1", [
            ["1526985054069-0", ["field1", "value1", "field2", "value2"]]
          ]],
          ["stream2", [...]]
        ]
        ```
        
        **Use cases:**
        - **Real-time processing:** React to events as they happen
        - **Live dashboards:** Display streaming data updates
        - **Event-driven systems:** Trigger actions on new events
        - **Data pipelines:** Process streams continuously
        - **Chat systems:** Get new messages in real-time
        
        **Blocking vs Non-blocking:** ‚ö°
        - **Non-blocking:** `XREAD STREAMS mystream 0` (immediate response)
        - **Blocking:** `XREAD BLOCK 1000 STREAMS mystream $` (wait up to 1 second)
        
        **Real-time patterns:** üîÑ
        - **Event processor:** Block forever waiting for events
        - **Live monitoring:** Poll with short timeouts
        - **Batch + Real-time:** Read history, then switch to blocking
        
        **Multi-stream example:** üåä
        ```
        XREAD BLOCK 0 STREAMS orders users notifications $ $ $
        # Monitor 3 streams simultaneously for new events

        ## ÔøΩ MULTI
        
        **Purpose:** Start a transaction block
        
        **Syntax:** `MULTI`
        
        **What it does:**
        - Begins a transaction
        - Following commands are queued, not executed immediately
        - Use EXEC to execute all queued commands atomically
        - Use DISCARD to cancel the transaction
        
        **Transaction Flow:**
        1. MULTI - Start transaction
        2. Command1, Command2, ... - Queue commands (each returns "QUEUED")
        3. EXEC - Execute all queued commands atomically
        
        **Atomicity guarantee:** üõ°Ô∏è 
        - Either ALL commands succeed, or if one fails, the transaction is aborted
        - No other client can interfere during execution
        - Perfect for operations that must happen together (like transferring money)
        
        **Use cases:**
        - Financial transactions: Transfer money between accounts
        - Batch updates: Update multiple related records
        - Race condition prevention: Ensure consistent state
        - Inventory management: Reserve items atomically

        **Purpose:** Execute all queued commands in the current transaction
        
        **Syntax:** `EXEC`
        
        **What it does:**
        - Executes ALL commands queued since MULTI in order
        - Returns an array containing the response of each executed command
        - Ends the transaction (back to normal mode)
        - If called without MULTI, returns error: "ERR EXEC without MULTI"
        - If transaction is empty (no commands queued), returns empty array
        
        **Response format:**
        - Array of results: Each element is the response from the corresponding queued command
        - Order preserved: Results match the order commands were queued
        - Empty array `[]` if no commands were queued
        
        **Atomicity:** ‚ö°
        - All commands execute as a single atomic operation
        - No other commands from other clients can interfere
        - If any command fails, previous ones in the transaction still completed
        
        **Use cases:**
        - Complete financial transfers
        - Batch data updates
        - Multi-step operations that must be consistent

        ## ‚ùå DISCARD
        
        **Purpose:** Cancel the current transaction and discard all queued commands
        
        **Syntax:** `DISCARD`
        
        **What it does:**
        - Cancels the current transaction started with MULTI
        - Discards ALL queued commands without executing them
        - Returns the client to normal (non-transaction) mode
        - Returns "OK" if successful
        - Returns error "ERR DISCARD without MULTI" if no transaction is active
        
        **When to use DISCARD:**
        - Error conditions detected before EXEC
        - User cancellation of pending operations
        - Logic requires aborting the transaction
        - Recovery from invalid states
        
        **Safety net:** üõ°Ô∏è 
        Changed your mind? Need to abort? DISCARD safely cancels everything!
        
        **Example scenario:** üè™
        E-commerce checkout - if credit card validation fails, DISCARD the transaction 
        instead of executing the inventory reservation and order creation.
        
        **Use cases:**
        - Error recovery: Cancel when validation fails
        - User cancellation: Shopping cart abandonment
        - Logic branching: Conditional transaction execution
        - Resource cleanup: Prevent partial operations
        
        **Transaction lifecycle:**

        SET item:123 reserved  # Queue command
